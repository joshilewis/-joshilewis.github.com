=Why I dislike Jira (and other similar tools)=

**TL;DR:** Jira (and similar tools) is great for keeping track of bugs, and for tracking, coordinating and auditing work. It is a terrible way to communicate and collaborate across a team. Don't use it as a communication tool.
--------
There are some common anti-patterns I've seen in organisations that use Jira (and other similar tools). This is what I've experienced in several environments: A team goes into Backlog Refinement and/or Sprint Planning and the Product Owner (or whomever is responsible for documenting requirements) projects Jira onto the screen in the boardroom. One by one, each work-item is opened individually and the PO reads through what he or she has written. There's a little bit of discussion, the delivery team decides they're ready to play planning poker, they do so and provide an estimate for the work-item, which is captured, and then they move on to the next work-item.

Almost all organisations I've experienced do not work in this way.  So let's examine the typical flow of events outlined above, where requirements are supplied by a PO and aren't defined collaboratively. Instead of having a conversation, what often happens is everyone just reads what's been written down. Yes, there is some discussion and a few questions, but fundamentally the conversation is framed (and limited) by what the PO had written down previously (however long ago that was). "We don't need a conversation because all you need to know is in Jira, just read it."

Because there is a lot of content, and because the PO clearly took a lot of time and effort to write all of this content, there is a tendency to avoid asking difficult question. It must be the correct solution, right? The PO must have thought of everything, right? How likely is the PO to be open to suggestions around solving the problem in a different way? (This is true for everyone, not just POs. Programmers are notorious for being attached to previous work.)

The opportunities for and likelihood of achieving **shared understanding** in this scenario are severely diminished. Because there is so much *stuff* written down, 'communication' must have taken place, right? We all understand what we're trying to achieve, right? The likelihood of coming up with a good solution to the problem is also severely diminished.








 - tool enslavement - workflows, configuration
  - emotional investment 
 - used as communication tool
  - PO enters lots of information
  - instead of having a conversation, PO says 'read Jira'
  - low-bandwidth, high-latency documentation
  - no opportunity for validation of understanding
  - not conducive to shared understanding
 - Because time and effort spent in writing stories a priori, more inclined to be married to those ideas, less open-minded to solving the problem
