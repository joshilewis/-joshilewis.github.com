=The Dimensions of Tests Model=

**TL;DR:** The types of tests you should have for your system should be determined by what feedback you want, and the cost of getting that feedback. They shoudn't be determined by what's easiest and cheapest to implement due to your system architecture. Useful dimensions to use when deciding what type of test you should write are primarily: speed of feedback, coverage, longevity and variability.
