=Lean Coffee - Lessons Learned Hosting & Facilitating=

**TL;DR:** Lessons learned from hosting and facilitating Lean Coffees at public meetups, within companies and at conferences.

--------

I have been hosting and facilitating Lean Coffee for a number of years now, for the [Lean Coffee JHB Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Lean-Coffee-JHB/), at companies where I've worked, and at several conferences I've attended. Along the way I've learned a few things about hosting and facilitating. Quite frequently people ask me for advice on starting a Lean Coffee. These are the lessons I've learned.

**Lean Coffee**
Lean Coffee is a lightweight structure for an informal gathering where the participants decide the agenda at the start of the gathering in a just-in-time way. The aim is to have many shallow discussions about a broad range of topics instead of deeply discussing only one or two topics. All you need for a Lean Coffee is somewhere to gather (hopefully with either good coffee or beer), someone to invite people, and someone to facilitate (after a while the gatherings become self-facilitating).

**Hosting**
Hosting means:
* Securing a space for the event. This may or may not need to be booked. For public events, we usually just show up at a coffee shop, sometimes without warning them. The venue should be appropriate for the number of people you're expecting (see Group Size below).
* Inviting people. Get the word out there. Most public Lean Coffee groups I know of use [meetup.com](meetup.com) which works well. For conferences, getting Lean Coffee added to the official conference program works well, as does Twitter, and getting conference hosts to announce it.
* Securing stationery for the gathering. This might entail bringing it yourself or asking other people (or a sponsor) to provide it. Generally all you need is a few pads of sticky notes, and some pens and/or markers. If at a conference, there's likely to be some stationery around that you can use. You may want a whiteboard or flipchart too depending on type of venue and number of people (see Facilitating below).
* Supply of good coffee and/or beer. Its ok for people to pay for their own coffee at a public Lean Coffee, try make sure there's decent stuff. 

Facilitating
Facilitating means you're holding the space and managing the flow of the event. You can think of it like being the traffic warden for the gathering. This typically includes the following:
