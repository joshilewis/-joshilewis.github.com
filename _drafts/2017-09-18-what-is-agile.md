= What is 'Agile'? =  
**TL;DR** Agile is a way of operating wherein the decisions we make are guided primarily by 4 trade-off statements expressed as value statements in the Agile Manifesto. Following this guidance is believed to lead to improved ways of developing software.

Recently I have again started to question what is meant by 'Agile' (I make no distinction between 'Agile' and 'agile'). I have asked this question at a few conferences, Lean Coffees etc. This is my current interpretation of 'Agile', as informed by the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/), specifically the first statement and the four value statements:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> Working software over comprehensive documentation
> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> Responding to change over following a plan
> 
> That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

These statements provide guidelines for trade-off decisions we should be making. If you're in a situation where you can choose between working on either `working software` or `comprehensive documentation`, rather choose `working software`, especially if you don't yet have `working software`.  

If you're in a situation where you have a plan but have discovered that the plan no longer makes sense, you can choose between either `following the plan` (even though you now know it no longer makes sense to do so), or `responding to the change`, the guidance from the Manifesto is to rather `respond to the change`. (I personally prefer `adapt to learning` over `respoding to change` but that's another story.)

The same thinking applies to the other two value statements: should you have to choose either `contract negotiation` or `customer collaboration`, rather choose the latter. If you need to choose between `processes and tools` and `individuals and interactions`, again rather choose the latter.

The original authors and signatories of the Manifesto believed, based on their collective experience, that if you follow these decision making guidelines, you will become `better` at developing software. I certainly don't disagree with them.
