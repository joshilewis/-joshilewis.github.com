= The Essence of SAFe =  
**TL;R**: Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) can look quite complicated and intimating at first glance. However the essence of SAFe is pretty simple:  
 * Plan-Do-Check-Act feedback loops at multiple levels (Team and Program)
 * Priority alignment at scale (ie across a large number of people)
 * Successive nested levels of work filtering and prioritisation
